This QGIS plugin serves to easily create model input TimML analytic element
models: https://github.com/mbakker7/timml

Analytic element input is typically a collection of points, lines, and polygons.
This plugin represent a single model with a single GeoPackage. The different
elements are represented as layers in the GeoPackage, and also as ordinary
vector layers in QGIS.

To run the model with TimML, this plugin relies on a second package called
`gistim`: https://pypi.org/project/gistim/
