QGIS-Tim is an open source project for multi-layer groundwater flow
simulations. QGIS-Tim provides a link between QGIS and the open source analytic
element method software: [TimML (steady-state)](https://github.com/mbakker7/timml)
and [TTim (transient)](https://github.com/mbakker7/ttim).

The benefit of the analytic element method (AEM) is that no grid or
time-stepping is required. Geohydrological features are represented by points,
lines, and polygons. QGIS-Tim stores these features in a
[GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/).

QGIS-Tim consists of a "front-end" and a "back-end". The front-end is a QGIS
plugin that provides a limited graphical interface to setup model input,
visualize, and analyze model input. The back-end is a Python package. It reads
the contents of the GeoPackage and transforms it into a TimML or TTim model,
computes a result, and writes it to a file that the QGIS plugin loads.
